This fork has been merged into the upstream CullLessLeaves Legacy repository:

Please use the original repository for future updates.

A version of yor42's CullLessLeaves Legacy that has been migrated to CleanroomModTemplate and integrated with Celeritas GUI.

I'm too nervous to submit a pull request, but I hope to do so someday.

### Description

Celeritas Leaf Culling is a mod that improves performance by hiding the inner faces of leaf blocks.

You can toggle ON/OFF and select from 4 presets (FAST, BALANCED, FANCY, CUSTOM) in the Celeritas GUI.

I do not intend to upload this mod to CurseForge or Modrinth.

#### Presets
- **FAST**: Maximum performance, slightly lower visual quality
- **BALANCED**: Good balance of performance and quality (default)
- **FANCY**: Best visual quality, slight performance impact
- **CUSTOM**: Manually adjust depth and random rejection settings

### Requirements
- CleanroomLoader 
- Celeritas
